# ⚡ Devgle (v2)

> **"Where Developers Connect, Anonymous & Distraction-Free."**

![Devgle Preview](public/demo.png)

## 🌟 Introduction

**Devgle** is not just another video chat app. It is a **digital sanctuary for developers**—a "Paper-Craft" themed environment designed to foster genuine connection, anonymous code reviews, and spontaneous debugging sessions.

Built with **privacy**, **aesthetics**, and **performance** in mind, Devgle uses the latest web technologies to deliver a premium experience without the bloat.

## 📢 Developers Assemble!

**This project needs YOU.** 🫵

Devgle is fully open-source because we believe the best tools are built *by* developers, *for* developers. We have the foundation—a beautiful UI, solid WebRTC networking, and a decentralized chat signaling system—but to truly bring this to life, **we need the community.**

Whether you're a React wizard, a WebRTC guru, or a UI/UX enthusiast, there is a place for you here.

**Why Contribute?**
- **Experiment with Modern Tech**: Play with Next.js 14, WebRTC, and GunJS (Decentralized Graph Database).
- **Shape the Product**: Help decide the future features. A code editor? Pair programming whiteboard? You decide.
- **Showcase Your Skills**: Build complex features like peer-to-peer screen sharing and real-time canvas drawing.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎭 Anonymous Matchmaking**: One-click connection to a random developer peer. No sign-ups, no tracking.
- **📹 HD Video & Audio**: Crystal clear, low-latency streams via native WebRTC.
- **🖥️ Screen Sharing**: Effortless, high-performance screen sharing for live debugging.
- **🎨 Paper-Craft UI**: A unique, calming aesthetic featuring layered elements, glassmorphism, and smooth micro-interactions.
- **📱 Mobile-First Design**:
  - **Auto-Stacking Layouts**: Video feeds adapt perfectly to mobile screens.
  - **Swipeable Controls**: "Zoom-style" touch controls for on-the-go meetings.
- **🔒 Decentralized Chat**: Zero-server chat logic powered by **GunJS** / **Trystero**. Your messages go directly to your peer.
- **🪟 Resizable Widgets**: Customize your view! Resize your local camera or connection preview to fit your workflow.
